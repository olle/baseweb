	<h1>Page Help</h1>
	<p>
		Page is the module where you can manage your web page content. When
		building the front end of you website you can place <em>slots</em> on
		the pages to enable room for editable content.
	</p>
	<p>
		Each slot gives you the ability to write content using the WYSIWYG
		editor, instead of coding it with HTML. You can apply styles, create
		links and add images to the content of a slot. And content in slots is
		always available to be changed in the editor.
	</p>
	<p>
		Slots in the front end will appear in the list to the left, showing the
		page and the name of the slot. Click on a slot to load and edit it's
		content. The WYSIWYG editor works in similar ways to any other document
		editor.
	</p>
	<p>
		Don't forget to save your changes by clicking the save-button at the
		bottom of the screen, under the editor.
