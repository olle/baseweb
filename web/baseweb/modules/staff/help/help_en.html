	<h1>Staff Help</h1>
	<p>
		Managing staff is divided up into two parts: Employees and Departments.
	</p>
	<h2>Employees</h2>
	<p>
		Employees are managed from the employee list, where you can click to
		edit or delete some employee. Each employee has basic information such
		as name, title and contact information, but employees also belong to
		departments.
	</p>
	<h2>Departments</h2>
	<p>
		A department is a named group of employees where each member can be
		ordered and have another title, instead of the default employee title,
		assigned to him or her. This allows for roles of employees to change 
		when presented in a department.
