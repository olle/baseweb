Baseweb
=======


Oh, *sigh* the days of past glory. This is what's left
over from a blissful project of the past - yet another
take at a _small but usefull CMS_.

## Tools for web sites

Instead of letting this brew, hidden (forgotten) on my
hard drive - I'm glad to put it out there for our
future source code archeologists.

### Getting it up and running

With an included Vagrant-box, there should be a good
chance this baby will actually run:

    vagrant up

Then browse to http://localhost:8888/baseweb. At the
given URL there should be the option (currently only
in swedish) to install ("Installera") the schema.

The rest is documented, the apropriate way, in the
code!

Enjoy!
